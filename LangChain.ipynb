For this reason, prudent generals have used\\ncipher and code messages from time immemorial. The necessity for\\nexact expression of ideas practically excludes the use of codes for\\nmilitary work although it is possible that a special tactical code\\nmight be useful for preparation of tactical orders.\\n\\nIt is necessary therefore to fall back on ciphers for general military\\nwork if secrecy of communication is to be fairly well assured. It\\nmay as well be stated here that no practicable military cipher is\\nmathematically indecipherable if intercepted; the most that can be\\nexpected is to delay for a longer or shorter time the deciphering of\\nthe message by the interceptor.', \"The capture of messengers is no longer the only means available to\\nthe enemy for gaining information as to the plans of a commander. All\\nradio messages sent out can be copied at hostile stations within radio\\nrange. If the enemy can get a fine wire within one hundred feet of a\\nbuzzer line or within thirty feet of a telegraph line, the message can\\nbe copied by induction. Messages passing over commercial telegraph\\nlines, and even over military lines, can be copied by spies in the\\noffices. On telegraph lines of a permanent nature it is possible to\\ninstall high speed automatic sending and receiving machines and thus\\nprevent surreptitious copying of messages, but nothing but a secure\\ncipher will serve with other means of communication.\\n\\nIt is not alone the body of the message which should be in cipher. It\\nis equally important that, during transmission, the preamble, place\\nfrom, date, address and signature be enciphered; but this should\\nbe done by the sending operator and these parts must, of course,\\nbe deciphered by the receiving operator before delivery. A special\\noperators' cipher should be used for this purpose but it is difficult\\nto prescribe one that would be simple enough for the average operator,\\nfast and yet reasonably safe. Some form of rotary cipher machine\\nwould seem to be best suited for this special purpose.\\n\\nIt is unnecessary to point out that a cipher which can be deciphered\\nby the enemy in a few hours is worse than useless. It requires a\\nsurprisingly long time to encipher and decipher a message, using even\\nthe simplest kind of cipher, and errors in transmission of cipher\\nmatter by wire or radio are unfortunately too common.\\n\\nKerckhoffs has stated that a military cipher should fulfill the\\nfollowing requirements:\\n\\n\\n    1st. The system should be materially, if not mathematically,\\n         indecipherable.\\n    2d.  It should cause no inconvenience if the apparatus and methods\\n         fall into the hands of the enemy.\\n    3d.  The key should be such that it could be communicated and\\n         remembered without the necessity of written notes and should\\n         be changeable at the will of the correspondents.\\n    4th. The system should be applicable to telegraphic correspondence.\\n    5th. The apparatus should be easily carried and a single person\\n         should be able to operate it.\\n    6th. Finally, in view of the circumstances under which it must\\n         be used, the system should be an easy one to operate,\\n         demanding neither mental strain nor knowledge of a long series\\n         of rules.\\n\\n\\nA brief consideration of these six conditions must lead to the\\nconclusion that there is no perfect military cipher. The first\\nrequirement is the one most often overlooked by those prescribing\\nthe use of any given cipher and, even if not overlooked, the\\nindecipherability of any cipher likely to be used for military purposes\\nis usually vastly overestimated by those prescribing the use of it.\", 'If this were not true, there would have been neither material for,\\nnor purpose in, the preparation of these notes. Of the hundreds of\\nactual cipher messages examined by the writer, at least nine-tenths\\nhave been solved by the methods to be set forth. These messages were\\nprepared by the methods in use by the United States Army, the various\\nMexican armies and their secret agents, and by other methods in common\\nuse. The usual failure has been with very short messages. Foreign\\nworks consulted lead to the belief that many European powers have\\nused, for military purposes, cipher methods which vary from an\\nextreme simplicity to a complexity which is more apparent than\\nreal. What effect recent events have had on this matter remains to\\nbe seen. It is enough that the cipher experts of practically every\\nEuropean country have appealed to the military authorities of their\\nrespective countries time and again to do away with these useless\\nciphers and to adopt something which offers more security, even at\\nthe expense of other considerations.\\n\\nThe cipher of the amateur, or of the non-expert who makes one up\\nfor some special purpose, is almost sure to fall into one of the\\nclasses whose solution is an easy matter. The human mind works along\\nthe same lines, in spite of an attempt at originality on the part of\\nthe individual, and this is particularly true of cipher work because\\nthere are so few sources of information available. In other words,\\nthe average man, when he sits down to evolve a cipher, has nothing\\nto improve upon; he invents and there is no one to tell him that his\\ninvention is, in principle, hundreds of years old. The ciphers of the\\nAbbé Tritheme, 1499, are the basis of most of the modern substitution\\nciphers.\\n\\nIn view of these facts, no message should be considered\\nindecipherable. Very short messages are often very difficult and may\\neasily be entirely beyond the possibility of analysis and solution,\\nbut it is surprising what can be done, at times, with a message of\\nonly a few words.\\n\\nIn the event of active operations, cipher experts will be in demand\\nat once. Like all other experts, the cipher expert is not born or\\nmade in a day; and it is only constant work with ciphers, combined\\nwith a thorough knowledge of their underlying principles, that will\\nmake one worthy of the name.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nEQUIPMENT FOR CIPHER WORK\\n\\n\\nSuccess in dealing with unknown ciphers is measured by these four\\nthings in the order named; perseverance, careful methods of analysis,\\nintuition, luck. The ability at least to read the language of the\\noriginal text is very desirable but not essential.\\n\\nCipher work will have little permanent attraction for one who expects\\nresults at once, without labor, for there is a vast amount of purely\\nroutine labor in the preparation of frequency tables, the rearrangement\\nof ciphers for examination, and the trial and fitting of letter to\\nletter before the message begins to appear.', 'The methods of analysis given in these notes cover only the simpler\\nvarieties of cipher and it is, of course, impossible to enumerate all\\nthe varieties of these. It is believed that the methods laid down are\\nsound and several years of successful work along this line would seem\\nto confirm this belief. For more advanced work there is no recourse\\nbut to study the European authorities whose writings are mostly in\\nFrench, German, and Italian and, unfortunately, are rarely available\\nin English translations.\\n\\nUnder intuition must be included a knowledge of the general situation\\nand, if possible, the special situation which led to the sending\\nof the cipher message. The knowledge or guess that a certain cipher\\nmessage contains a particular word, often leads to its solution.\\n\\nAs to luck, there is the old miner\\'s proverb: \"Gold is where you\\nfind it.\"\\n\\nThe equipment for an office, where much cipher work is handled,\\nwill now be considered. The casual worker with ciphers can get along\\nwith much less, but the methods of filing and keeping a record of all\\nmessages studied should be followed wherever possible. The interchange\\nof results between individuals and between offices should be encouraged\\nand, in time of active operations, should be mandatory. An enemy\\nmay be using the same cipher in widely separated parts of the zone\\nof operations and it is useless labor to have many cipher offices\\nworking on intercepted messages, all in the same cipher, when one\\noffice may have the solution that will apply to all of them.\\n\\nCipher work requires concentration and quiet and often must proceed\\nwithout regard to hours. The office should be chosen with these points\\nin mind. A clerical force is desirable and even necessary if there\\nis much work to do. The clerk or clerks can soon be trained to do\\nthe routine part of the analysis.\\n\\nIt is believed that each Field Army should have such an office\\nwhere all ciphers intercepted by forces under command of the Field\\nArmy Commander should be sent at once for examination. This work\\nnaturally falls to the Intelligence section of the General Staff at\\nthis headquarters. A special radio station, with receiving instruments\\nonly, should be an adjunct to this office and its function should\\nbe to copy all hostile radio messages whether in cipher or plain\\ntext. Such a radio station requires but a small antenna; one of the\\npack set type or any amateur\\'s antenna is sufficient, and the station\\ninstruments can be easily carried in a suit case. Three thoroughly\\ncompetent operators should be provided, so that the station can be\\n\"listening in\" during the entire twenty-four hours.', 'The office should be provided with tables of frequency of the language\\nof the enemy, covering single letters and digraphs; a dictionary and\\ngrammar of that language; copies of the War Department Code, Western\\nUnion Code and any other available ones; types of apparatus or, at\\nleast, data on apparatus and cipher methods in use by the enemy; and\\na safe filing cabinet and card index for filing messages examined. A\\ntypewriter is also desirable.\\n\\nThe office work on a cipher under examination should be done on paper\\nof a standard and uniform size. Printed forms containing twenty-six\\nruled lines and a vertical alphabet are convenient and save time in\\npreparation of frequency tables. Any new cipher methods which are\\nfound to be in use by the enemy should, when solved, be communicated\\nto all similar offices in the Army for their information.\\n\\nUnless an enemy were exceedingly vigilant and changed keys and methods\\nfrequently, such an office would, in a few days, be in a position\\nto disclose completely all intercepted cipher communications of the\\nenemy with practically no delay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nPRINCIPLES OF MECHANISM OF A WRITTEN LANGUAGE\\n\\n\\nWith a few exceptions, notably Chinese, all modern languages are\\nconstructed of words which in turn are formed from letters. In any\\ngiven language the number of letters, and their conventional order is\\nfixed. Thus English is written with 26 letters and their conventional\\norder is A, B, C, D, E, etc. Some letters are used very frequently and\\nothers rarely. In fact, if ten thousand consecutive letters of a text\\nbe counted and the frequency of occurrence of each letter be noted,\\nthe numbers found will be practically identical with those obtained\\nfrom any other text of ten thousand letters in the same language. The\\nrelative proportion of occurrence of the various letters will also\\nhold approximately for even very short texts.\\n\\nSuch a count of a large number of letters, when it is put in the form\\nof a table, is known as a frequency table. Every language has its own\\ndistinctive frequency table and, for any given language, the frequency\\ntable is almost as fixed as the alphabet. There are minor differences\\nin frequency tables prepared from texts on special subjects. For\\nexample, if the text be newspaper matter, the frequency table will\\ndiffer slightly from one prepared from military orders and will also\\ndiffer slightly from one prepared from telegraph messages. But these\\ndifferences are very slight as compared with the differences between\\nthe frequency tables of two different languages.\\n\\nAgain there is a fixed ratio of occurrence of every letter with every\\nother for any language and this, put in table form, constitutes a\\ntable of frequency of digraphs. In the same way a table of trigraphs,\\nshowing the ratio of occurrence of any three letters in sequence,\\ncould be prepared, but such a table would be very extensive and a\\ncount of the more common three letter combinations is usually used.', 'Other tables, such as frequency of initial and final letters of words,\\nmight be of value but the common practice is to put cipher text into\\ngroups of five or ten letters each and eliminate word forms. This is\\nalmost a necessity in telegraphic and radio communication to enable\\nthe receiving operator to check correct receipt of a message. He\\nmust get five letters, neither more nor less, per word or he is\\nsure a mistake has been made. There is little difficulty, as a rule,\\nin restoring word forms in the deciphered message.\\n\\nWe will now take up, in order, the various frequency tables and\\nlinguistic peculiarities of English and Spanish. Frequency tables\\nfor French, German, and Italian for single letters will follow. All\\nfrequency tables have been re-calculated from at least ten thousand\\nletters of text and compared with existing tables. No marked difference\\nhas been found in any case between the re-calculated tables and those\\nalready in use.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData for Solution of Ciphers in English\\n\\nTable I.--Normal frequency table.

English words are derived from so\\nmany sources that it is not impossible for any letter to occur as an\\ninitial or final of a word, although Q, X and Z are rare as initials\\nand B, I, J, Q, V, X and Z are rare as finals.\\n\\n\\nLetters  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z\\nInitial  9  6  6  5  2  4  2  3  3  1  1  2  4  2 10  2  -  4  5 17  2  -  7  -  3  -\\nFinal    1  -  - 10 17  6  4  2  -  -  1  6  1  9  4  1  -  8  9 11  1  -  1  -  8  -\\n\\n\\nIt is practically impossible to find five consecutive letters in an\\nEnglish text without a vowel and we may expect from one to three with\\ntwo as the general average. In any twenty letters we may expect to\\nfind from 6 to 9 vowels with 8 as an average. Among themselves the\\nrelative frequency of occurrence of each of the vowels, (including\\nY when a vowel) is as follows:\\n\\n\\n                  A,   19.5%   E,   32.0%   I,   16.7%\\n                  O,   20.2%   U,   8.0%    Y,   3.6%\\n\\n\\nThe foregoing tables give all the essential facts about the mechanism\\nof the English language from the standpoint of the solution of\\nciphers. The use to be made of these tables will be evident when the\\nsolution of different types of ciphers is taken up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData for the Solution of Ciphers in Spanish\\n\\nThe Spanish language is written with the following alphabet:\\n\\n\\n                A  B  C  CH  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  L  LL\\n              M  N  Ñ  O  P  Q  R  RR  S  T  U  V  X  Y  Z\\n\\n\\nwhile the exact sense often depends upon the use of accents over the\\nvowels. However, in cipher work it is exceedingly inconvenient to use\\nthe permanent digraphs, CH, LL and RR and they do not appear as such in\\nany specimens of Spanish or Mexican cipher examined. Accented vowels\\nand Ñ are also not found and we may, in general, say that a cipher\\nwhose text is Spanish will be prepared with the following alphabet:', 'A B C D E F G H I J L M N O P Q R S T U V X Y Z\\n\\n\\nand the receiver must supply the accents and the tilde over the N to\\nconform to the general sense.\\n\\nHowever, many Mexican cipher alphabets contain the letters K and\\nW. This is particularly true of the ciphers in use by secret service\\nagents who must be prepared to handle words like NEW YORK, WILSON\\nand WASHINGTON. The letters K and W will, however, have a negligible\\nfrequency except in short messages where words like these occur more\\nthan once.\\n\\nIn this connection, if a cipher contains Mexican geographical names\\nlike CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO, MUZQUIZ, the letters H, X and Z will have a\\nsomewhat exaggerated frequency.\\n\\nIn Spanish, the letter Q is always followed by U and the U is always\\nfollowed by one of the other vowels, A, E, I or O. As QUE or QUI\\noccurs not infrequently in Spanish text, particularly in telegraphic\\ncorrespondence, it is well worth noting that, if a Q occurs in a\\ntransposition cipher, we must connect it with U and another vowel. The\\nclue to several transposition ciphers has been found from this simple\\nrelation.\\n\\n\\nTable VII.--Normal frequency table for military orders and reports,\\ncalculated on a basis of 10,000 letters of Spanish text.

Thus, in two thousand letters, we may expect to find AI\\ntwice and IA twenty-three times.\\n\\n\\n\\n     A   B    C    D    E   F   G    H    I   J    L    M    N    O    P    Q    R    S    T    U   V   X   Y   Z', 'A    9   4   19   11    5       6   17   23       54   18    9    3   20        29   11   21    8   6       2   5   A\\nB    6                                    3             1         4                                                 B\\nC   24        6    6   24                 5        3         8    8              9    5         2           2       C\\nD   31                 29                 3                 19   13             10    9                     4       D\\nE   12   2    6   59   10       1    5    7   2   12   18   22    4    9        38   25   28   25   3       3       E\\nF    4                  4                          4         3                        3                     1       F\\nG    2                  4                 8                  4                                                  2   G\\nH    2       12        10                                                             2                     1       H\\nI    2       23   16        5   2                  3   11   13                   6   10    5        3               I\\nJ    3                  2                                    1                                                      J\\nL   21   3    6        39   3   3         7       21         5    6             12    2         2                   L\\nM   12                  6                 5        1         6   15              7    2         6           1       M\\nN   32                 46       2         8                      32                            12           2       N\\nO            26   22    2   6   3    4    9       16    2    8        20        15    7   11                        O\\nP   13                  3                 2        4    9    2    7              4   11                             P\\nQ   11   5                                         1         2                   3         1                        Q\\nR   40                 27   2             4        4             36    3        11        17    3                   R\\nS   39                 52                10                  7   14              2             14           3       S\\nT    5                 13                 4        4        18    5              6   30                             T\\nU    2        4    2    6   3   4             5         2    6         4   17        15    2                1       U\\nV    2                  2                          2              2                   2                     2       V\\nX                                                                                                                   X\\nY    5                  6                                         2                   5         2               2   Y\\nZ    1                  2                                    1                   4              2                   Z\\n\\n     A   B    C    D    E   F   G    H    I   J    L    M    N    O    P    Q    R    S    T    U   V   X   Y   Z', 'Table IX.--Order of frequency of common pairs to be expected in a\\ncount of 2,000 letters of Spanish military orders and reports.

'CHAPTER III\\n\\nTECHNIQUE OF CIPHER EXAMINATION\\n\\n\\nIn time of active operations it is important that captured or\\nintercepted cipher messages reach the examining office with the least\\npossible delay. The text of messages, captured at a distance from\\nthe examining office, should be sent to the office by telegraph or\\ntelephone, the original messages being forwarded to the office as\\nsoon thereafter as possible.\\n\\nThe preamble, \"place from,\" date, address and signature, give most\\nimportant clues as to the language of the cipher, the cipher method\\nprobably used, and even the subject matter of the message. If the whole\\nof a telegraphic or radio message is in cipher, it is highly probable\\nthat the preamble, \"place from,\" etc., are in an operators\\' cipher\\nand are distinct from the body of the message. As these operators\\'\\nciphers are necessarily simple, an attempt should always be made to\\ndiscover, by methods of analysis to be set forth later, the exact\\nextent of the operator\\'s cipher and then to decipher the parts of\\nthe messages enciphered with it.\\n\\nIn military messages, we almost invariably find the language of the\\ntext to be that of the nation to which the military force belongs. The\\nlanguage of the text of the message of secret agents is, however,\\nanother matter and, in dealing with such messages, we should use all\\navailable evidence, both external and internal, before deciding finally\\non the language used. Whenever a frequency table can be prepared,\\nsuch a table will give the best evidence for this purpose.\\n\\nAll work in enciphering and deciphering messages and in copying ciphers\\nshould be done with capital letters. There is much less chance of\\nerror when working with capitals and, with little practice, it is\\njust about as fast. An additional safeguard is to use black ink or\\npencil for the plain text and colored ink or pencil for the cipher. A\\nseparate color may be used for the key when necessary.\\n\\nThe following blank form is suggested as convenient for keeping a\\nrecord of a cipher under examination. It should accompany the cipher\\nthrough the examining process and should be filled in as the facts\\nare determined. This record, the original cipher and all notes of\\nwork done during the examination, should be filed together when\\nthe examination is completed, whether the cipher has been solved or\\nnot. It may be that other ciphers solved later will give clues to\\nthe solution of such unsolved ciphers.\\n\\nThe first column of this blank should be filled out from data furnished\\nby the officer obtaining the cipher from the enemy. A general\\norder, emphasizing the importance of promptly forwarding captured\\nor intercepted ciphers to an examining office, could specify that a\\nbrief report embodying this data should be forwarded with each cipher.', 'The second column of the blank should be filled out progressively\\nas the work proceeds. The office number should be a serial one, the\\nfirst cipher examined being No. 1. The date and hour of receipt at\\nexamining office will be a check as to the time required to transmit\\nit from place of capture. The spaces \"From,\" \"At,\" \"To,\" \"At,\" \"Date,\"\\nare for the information concerning sender and addressee of the cipher\\nand are to be obtained from the message. In case an operators\\' cipher\\nhas been used, these parts of the message will have to be deciphered\\nbefore the blanks can be filled in.\\n\\n\\n\\n                  Intelligence Section, General Staff\\n                             1st Field Army\\n\\n                       -------------------------------------------------\\n                               Place,                      Date\\n\\n                      Record of Cipher Examination\\n\\nThis cipher obtained by               Office No. -----------------------\\n\\n                                      Received ------------- -----------\\n----------------------------------                 (Date)       (Hour)\\n\\n----------------------------------    From -----------------------------\\n\\nat -------------------------------    At -------------------------------\\n\\non ---------------- --------------    To -------------------------------\\n       (date)           (hour)\\n                                      At -------------------------------\\nHow being transmitted when obtained.\\n(Underscore means used and enter      Date -----------------------------\\ndata on sending and receiving\\nstations).

Thus a cipher from\\na Mexican source and not containing K or W is probably in Spanish.\\n\\nThe class and case are determined by the rules laid down later. The\\nspace for remarks is to permit notation of any special features. When\\nthe solution is completed, the date and hour are noted, the language\\nof text and key (if determined) are entered and a type number, to\\nidentify it with other ciphers prepared by the same method (but not\\nnecessarily the same key), is given to it. The file number is for\\nconvenience in filing and in preparation of a card index.\\n\\nThe process of examination in an office with one examiner, one\\nstenographer and one clerk, might be as follows: On receipt of a\\ncaptured cipher with accompanying report, the stenographer makes four\\ncopies of the cipher on the typewriter. The clerk and stenographer then\\ncheck the work. The stenographer then proceeds to fill out the first\\ncolumn and first two lines of the second column of the record blank\\nfrom the report of the capturing officer, keeping the original cipher\\nand two copies with the record. He may also fill out the first seven\\nlines of the second column, if this data is on the captured cipher in\\nplain text. In the meantime the clerk is counting and setting down the\\nwhole number of letters of the cipher and the occurrence of AEIOU,\\nLNRST, and JKQXZ, while the examining officer is looking over the\\ncipher for possible recurring groups of letters and underlining them\\nwhen found.\\n\\nThis work being completed, the examining officer is in a position,\\nordinarily, to decide on the class of the cipher and he may have found\\nsomething in his examination which will lead him to the case under the\\nclass. The clerk in this preliminary count should keep track of the\\ntotal occurrence of each of the fifteen check letters and not of the\\nthree groups given above. This takes a little longer but when done,\\nthe data for fifteen letters of the alphabet for a frequency table is\\ncompleted, leaving only eleven other letters, and in Spanish, but nine,\\nto be counted, in case it is necessary to prepare a frequency table.', \"If the examining officer decides the cipher to be of the transposition\\nclass, no further work with frequency tables is necessary. The\\nclerk should proceed to count and set down the number of vowels in\\neach line and column and the examining officer should look for any\\noccurrence of the letter Q and try to connect it with U and another\\nvowel. The stenographer may be set to work putting the cipher into\\nrectangles of different dimensions. The clerk's work gives data for\\npossible rearrangement, for if the vowels are much out of proportion\\nat any point, they must be connected with the proper proportion of\\nconsonants as a first step in rearrangement. Work with transposition\\nciphers must necessarily include much of the fit and try method. The\\ndetails of this work are taken up later.\\n\\nIf a cipher seems to be a substitution cipher, the examining officer\\nshould look over the frequency of occurrence of each of the fifteen\\nletters counted. If some letters (it is of no importance at present\\nwhich ones) occur much more frequently than others and some occur\\nrarely or not at all, we may safely decide on Case 4, 5 or 6 and let\\nthe clerk proceed to finish the frequency table for the message. On the\\nother hand, if all the fifteen letters examined occur with somewhere\\nnear the same frequency--for example, the most common letter occurring\\nnot over three or four times as often as the least common letter--we\\nmay at once eliminate the first three cases and let the clerk proceed\\nto examine the cipher for recurring pairs and groups, counting the\\nintervening letters, so that the examining officer may decide whether\\nCase 7, or some more complicated case, should be chosen.\\n\\nIf something more complicated than Case 7 has been used and other\\nciphers are on hand awaiting examination, the cipher should go into\\nthe unsolved file to be worked on when other work permits, unless\\nthe contents of the cipher are believed to be very important. Every\\nopportunity should be taken to clean up the unsolved file and, whenever\\na message is solved, the methods should be tried, if applicable,\\nto everything remaining in the file.\\n\\nThe first few days or weeks after the establishment of an examining\\noffice will be the most trying time. When solved ciphers begin to\\npile up, the methods of the enemy will be more and more apparent and\\nit will often be possible to determine the method from knowledge of\\nthe name of the sender and receiver.\\n\\nWhen a cipher has been solved, the solution should be prepared in\\ntriplicate and given the serial number of the cipher. Any parts which\\nare not clear, through errors in enciphering or in transmission,\\nshould be underlined or otherwise made conspicuous, so that the head\\nof the Intelligence Section may note them and, possibly, from other\\nsources, supply the deficiency.\", 'One of the copies of the cipher and report of examination, with a\\ncopy of the solution, should be turned over at once to the head of\\nthe Intelligence Section or to the Chief of Staff. The other copies\\nof the solution should be filed with the original cipher, the report\\nof examination, and all work done on the cipher.\\n\\nPeriodically, say once a week or even daily at the beginning of\\nactive operations, there should be an interchange between all\\nexamining offices of solved messages involving new methods used by\\nthe enemy. All the examining offices will thus be kept in touch. It\\nmay also be possible to assign certain hostile radio stations to each\\nexamining office to prevent duplication of work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nCLASSES OF CIPHERS\\n\\n\\nThere are, in general, two classes of ciphers. These are the\\ntransposition cipher and the substitution cipher.\\n\\nSubstitution ciphers may be made up of substituted letters, numerals,\\nconventional signs or combinations of all three; and furthermore,\\nfor a single letter of the original text there may be substituted a\\nsingle letter, numeral or sign or two or more of each, or a whole\\nword or group of figures, combination of conventional signs, or\\ncombinations of all three of these elements. Thus substitution ciphers\\nmay vary from those of extreme simplicity to those whose complication\\ndefies any ordinary method of analysis and whose solution requires\\nthe possession of long messages and much time and study. Fortunately\\nthe more difficult substitution ciphers are rarely used for military\\npurposes, on account of the time and care required for enciphering\\nand deciphering.\\n\\nTransposition ciphers are limited to the characters of the original\\ntext. These characters are rearranged singly, according to some\\npredetermined method or key (monoliteral transposition), or whole\\nwords are similarly rearranged (route cipher).\\n\\nThere may also be a combination of transposition and substitution\\nmethods in enciphering a message but in this case it will fall into\\nthe substitution class on first determination and after solution\\nas a substitution cipher it must be handled as a transposition\\ncipher. Examples of this case will be given.\\n\\nWe may also find transposition or substitution methods applied to\\nwords taken from a code book, or to numbers which represent these\\nwords. Thus cipher methods blend into code work, for a code is,\\nafter all, only a specialized substitution cipher.\\n\\nWe can now lay down the rules for determining whether any given cipher\\nbelongs to the substitution class or to the transposition class.\\n\\nCount the number of letters in the message, the number of vowels,\\nAEIOU, the number of the consonants, LNRST, and the number of the\\nconsonants, JKQXZ.\\n\\nIf the text is English and the cipher is a transposition cipher,\\nthis proportion will hold; vowels AEIOU constitute 40% of the whole;\\nconsonants LNRST, 30% and consonants JKQXZ, 3%.', 'If the text be Spanish the proportions for a transposition cipher\\nwill be: vowels AEIOU 45%, consonants LNRST, 30%; consonants JKQXZ, 2%.\\n\\nIf these proportions do not hold within 5%, one way or the other,\\nthe cipher is certainly a substitution cipher. Note, however,\\nthat often the end of a message is filled with letters like K, X,\\nZ to complete cipher words and it is best to neglect the last word\\nor words in making a count. Also, if the cipher be a long one, this\\ndetermination can safely be made by taking 100 or 200 consecutive\\nletters of the message, either from the beginning or, if nulls at\\nthe beginning are suspected, from the interior of the message.\\n\\nThe distinction between the route cipher (transposition) and the\\nsubstitution cipher where whole words are substituted for letters of\\nthe original text, must be made on the basis of the words actually\\nused. It is better to consider such a message as a route cipher when\\nthe words used appear to have some consecutive meaning bearing on the\\nsituation at hand. A substitution cipher of this variety would only\\nbe used for transmission of a short message of great importance and\\nsecrecy, and then the chances are that certain words corresponding to\\nA, E, N, O and T would appear with such frequency as to point at once\\nto the fact that a substitution cipher was used. Watch the initial\\nor terminal letters in such a cipher; they may spell the message.\\n\\nIn general, the determination of class by proportion of vowels,\\ncommon consonants and rare consonants may be safely followed. We will\\nnow proceed to the examination of the more common varieties of each\\nclass of cipher.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nEXAMINATION OF TRANSPOSITION CIPHERS\\n\\n\\nAfter having decided that a cipher belongs to the transposition class,\\nit remains to decide on the variety of cipher used. As, by definition,\\na transposition cipher consists wholly of characters of the original\\nmessage, rearranged according to some law, we may, in general, say that\\nsuch a cipher offers fewer difficulties in solution than a substitution\\ncipher. A transposition cipher is like a picture puzzle; the parts are\\nall there and the solution merely involves their correct arrangement.\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1.--Geometrical ciphers. This case includes all ciphers in which\\na certain number of the characters are chosen so that they will form\\na square or rectangle of predetermined dimensions; and then these\\ncharacters are arranged according to a geometrical design.\\n\\nTaking the message:\\n\\n\\n            A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X\\n\\n\\nof twenty-four letters and assuming a rectangle of six letters\\nhorizontally, and four letters vertically, we may have:\\n\\n\\n(a) Simple Horizontal:\\n\\n         A B C D E F   F E D C B A   S T U V W X   X W V U T S\\n         G H I J K L   L K J I H G   M N O P Q R   R Q P O N M\\n         M N O P Q R   R Q P O N M   G H I J K L   L K J I H G\\n         S T U V W X   X W V U T S   A B C D E F   F E D C B A\\n\\n\\n(b) Simple Vertical:', '(b) Simple Vertical:\\n\\n         A E I M Q U   D H L P T X   U Q M I E A   X T P L H D\\n         B F J N R V   C G K O S W   V R N J F B   W S O K G C\\n         C G K O S W   B F J N R V   W S O K G C   V R N J F B\\n         D H L P T X   A E I M Q U   X T P L H D   U Q M I E A\\n\\n\\n(c) Alternate Horizontal:\\n\\n         A B C D E F   F E D C B A   X W V U T S   S T U V W X\\n         L K J I H G   G H I J K L   M N O P Q R   R Q P O N M\\n         M N O P Q R   R Q P O N M   L K J I H G   G H I J K L\\n         X W V U T S   S T U V W X   A B C D E F   F E D C B A\\n\\n\\n(d) Alternate Vertical:\\n\\n         A H I P Q X   D E L M T U   X Q P I H A   U T M L E D\\n         B G J O R W   C F K N S V   W R O J G B   V S N K F C\\n         C F K N S V   B G J O R W   V S N K F C   W R O J G B\\n         D E L M T U   A H I P Q X   U T M L E D   X Q P I H A\\n\\n\\n(e) Simple Diagonal:\\n\\n         A B D G K O   G K O S V X   O K G D B A   X V S O K G\\n         C E H L P S   D H L P T W   S P L H E C   W T P L H D\\n         F I M Q T V   B E I M Q U   V T Q M I F   U Q M I E B\\n         J N R U W X   A C F J N R   X W U R N J   R N J F C A\\n\\n         A C F J N R   J N R U W X   R N J F C A   X W U R N J\\n         B E I M Q U   F I M Q T V   U Q M I E B   V T Q M I F\\n         D H L P T W   C E H L P S   W T P L H D   S P L H E C\\n         G K O S V X   A B D G K O   X V S O K G   O K G D B A\\n\\n\\n(f) Alternate Diagonal:\\n\\n         A B F G N O   G N O U V X   O N G F B A   X V U O N G\\n         C E H M P U   F H M P T W   U P M H E C   W T P M H F\\n         D I L Q T V   B E I L Q S   V T Q L I D   S Q L I E B\\n         J K R S W X   A C D J K R   X W S R K J   R K J D C A\\n\\n         A C D J K R   J K R S W X   R K J D C A   X W S R K J\\n         B E I L Q S   D I L Q T V   S Q L I E B   V T Q L I D\\n         F H M P T W   C E H M P U   W T P M H F   U P M H E C\\n         G N O U V X   A B F G N O   X V U O N G   O N G F B A\\n\\n\\n(g) Spiral, clockwise:\\n\\n         A B C D E F   L M N O P A   I J K L M N   D E F G H I\\n         P Q R S T G   K V W X Q B   H U V W X O   C R S T U J\\n         O X W V U H   J U T S R C   G T S R Q P   B Q X W V K\\n         N M L K J I   I H G F E D   F E D C B A   A P O N M L\\n\\n\\n(h) Spiral, counter clockwise:\\n\\n         A P O N M L   N M L K J I   I H G F E D   F E D C B A\\n         B Q X W V K   O X W V U H   J U T S R C   G T S R Q P\\n         C R S T U J   P Q R S T G   K V W X Q B   H U V W X O\\n         D E F G H I   A B C D E F   L M N O P A   I J K L M N\\n\\n\\nIt is simply a matter of inspection to read a message in a cipher\\nof this type, once the dimensions of the rectangles have been\\ndetermined.

It is best however to try the largest\\npossible rectangles first so we will put it in the form 5 × 24, thus:\\n\\n\\nM  S  I  B  R  O  R  S  E  E  V  U  E  E  M  C  O  R  E  R  E  L  I  D\\nE  T  O  E  P  Q  E  N  R  E  R  N  S  E  R  Y  E  C  O  L  L  E  R  E\\nU  S  P  L  U  R  C  E  L  O  A  J  A  E  H  U  H  P  F  A  S  O  N  N\\nO  A  A  E  P  I  U  A  P  P  E  A  C  U  Q  A  R  U  O  P  O  E  I  I\\nR  R  M  I  A  F  D  A  A  R  Q  U  B  O  Z  A  E  G  E  R  S  F  S  X\\n\\n\\nHere an inspection shows this to be Case 1-f, alternate diagonal,\\nand the text to be \"ME SITUO SOBRE PARRAL PORQUE ME PRESENCIA FUE\\nREVELADA POR U\"; here the sense breaks but note that U is the twelfth\\nletter of the line and continue as if the rectangle were 5 × 12 and\\nwe have \"NA PAREJA QU.\" Now inspect the second rectangle of 5 × 12\\nin the same way and the sense continues \"E SE ME ACERCO Y HUBO QUE\\nRECHAZAR POR EL FUEGO ALLI ESRERO ORDENES FINISX\".', \"The practical way of examining a cipher of this type is to have several\\nmen prepare rectangles of different dimensions, using the letters of\\nthe cipher in the order received. The rectangles can be inspected very\\nrapidly when once prepared. Note that the dimensions of any rectangle\\nwill rarely be such as to contain more than fifty letters, on account\\nof the necessity of filling up a rectangle with nulls if the number\\nof letters of the message is just a little greater than a multiple of\\nthe rectangle. Also large rectangles give, for all but the diagonal\\nmethod, whole words in a line or column and these are easily noted.\\n\\nThe following ciphers come under Case 1:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 1-i.--The rail fence cipher, useful as an operators' cipher but\\npermits of no variation and is therefore read almost as easily as\\nstraight text when the method is known.

It was, even in those days, frankly only\\na delaying cipher and, to be of any value, had to be filled with\\nmeaningless words to conceal the message proper. An example from\\nthe Signal Book will suffice to show the general character of route\\nciphers.

It does not\\nfulfill the first, second, and third of Kerckhoffs' requirements as\\nto indecipherability, safety when apparatus and method fall into the\\nhands of the enemy, and dependability on a readily changeable key word.\\n\\nHowever, transposition ciphers are often encountered. They are\\nfavorites with those who find the substitution ciphers too difficult\\nand too tedious to handle and who believe that their transposition\\nmethods are either absolutely indecipherable or sufficiently so\\nfor the purpose of concealing the text of a message for the time\\nbeing. They seem to be particularly popular with secret agents and\\nspies, presumably because special apparatus is rarely necessary in\\nenciphering and deciphering.\\n\\nAlthough the number of transposition methods is legion, they can\\npractically all be considered under one of the three cases already\\ndiscussed. It is surprising how often transposition ciphers prepared\\nby complicated rules, will, on analysis, be seen to be very simple.\\n\\nTo be successful in solving transposition ciphers, one should\\nconstantly practice reading backward and up and down columns, so that\\nthe common combinations of letters are as quickly identified when seen\\nthus as when encountered in straight text. Combinations like EHT,\\nLLIW, ROF, DNA, etc., should be appreciated immediately as common\\nwords written backward.\\n\\nA study of the table of frequency of digraphs or pairs is also\\nexcellent practice and such a table should be at hand when a\\ntransposition cipher is under consideration. It assists greatly if\\nCase 2 be encountered and is of considerable use in solving Case 1.\\n\\nThe solution of route ciphers is necessarily one of try and fit,\\nwith the knowledge that such ciphers usually are read up and down\\ncolumns. It is not believed that route ciphers will often be met with\\nat the present day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nEXAMINATION OF SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS\\n\\n\\nWhen an unknown cipher has been put into the substitution class by\\nthe methods already described we may proceed to decide on the variety\\nof substitution cipher which has been used.\\n\\nThere are a few purely mechanical ways of solving some of the simple\\ncases of substitution ciphers but as a general rule some or all of\\nthe following determinations must be made:\", '1. By preparation of a frequency table for the message we determine\\nwhether one or more substitution alphabets have been used and, if\\none only has been used, this table leads to the solution.\\n\\n2. By certain rules we determine how many alphabets have been used,\\nif there are more than one, and then isolate and analyze each alphabet\\nby means of a frequency table.\\n\\n3. If the two preceding steps give no results we have to deal with a\\ncipher with a running key, a cipher of the Playfair type, or a cipher\\nwhere two or more characters are substituted for each letter of the\\ntext. Some special cases under this third head will be given but,\\nin general, military ciphers of the substitution class will usually\\nbe found to come under the first two heads, on account of the time\\nand care required in the preparation and deciphering of messages by\\nthe last named methods and the necessity, in many cases, of using\\ncomplicated machines for these processes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 4-a.\\n\\nMessage\\n\\n\\n           OBQFO BPBRP QBAML OBHIF PILFQ FJBOX OFLNR BIXOZ EL\\n\\n\\nFrom the recurrence of B, F and O, we may conclude that a single\\nsubstitution alphabet was used for this message. If so and if the\\nalphabet runs in the same order and direction as the regular alphabet,\\nthe simplest way to discover the meaning of the message is to take\\nthe first two words and write alphabets under each letter as follows,\\nuntil some line makes sense:\\n\\n\\n                          O B Q F O B P B R P\\n                          P C R G P C Q C S Q\\n                          Q D S H Q D R D T R\\n                          R E T I R E S E U S\\n\\n\\nThe word RETIRESE occurs in the fourth line, and, if the whole message\\nbe handled in this way we find the rest of the fourth line to read\\nUSTED POR EL MISMO ITINERARIO QUE MARCHO.

By trying B = E we find that the two tables\\nagree in a general way very well and this is all that can be expected\\nwith such a short message. The longer the message the nearer would\\nits frequency table agree with the standard table. Note that if a\\ncipher disk has been used, the alphabet runs the other way and we\\nmust count upward in working with a graphic table. Note also that if,\\nin a fairly long message, it is impossible to coördinate the graphic\\ntable, reading either up or down, with the standard table and yet some\\nletters occur much more frequently than others and some do not occur\\nat all, we have a mixed alphabet to deal with. The example chosen for\\ncase 6-a is of this character. An examination of the frequency table\\ngiven under that case shows that it bears no graphic resemblance to the\\nstandard table. However, as will be seen in case 7-b, the preparation\\nof graphic tables enables us to state definitely that the same order\\nof letters is followed in each of a number of mixed alphabets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Remarks\\n\\nAny substitution cipher, enciphered by a single alphabet composed of\\nletters, figures or conventional signs, can be handled by the methods\\nof case 6. For example, the messages under case 4-a and 5-a are easily\\nsolved by these methods. But note that the messages under case 4-b\\nand 5-b cannot so be solved because several alphabets are used. We\\nwill see later that there are methods of segregating the different\\nalphabets in some cases where several are used and then each of the\\nalphabets is to be handled as below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 6-a.\\n\\nMessage\\n\\n    QDBYP BXHYS OXPCP YSHCS EDRBS ZPTPB BSCSB PSHSZ AJHCD OSEXV HPODA\\n    PBPSZ BSVXY XSHCD\\n\\n\\nThis message was received from a source which makes us sure it is in\\nSpanish.

The proportion in the case of the vowels\\nis somewhat too large and, in the case of the letters LRNST, it is\\ntoo small. It is then questionable whether this is a transposition\\ncipher altho, at first glance it might appear to be one.\\n\\nOn examination for parts of possible words we are at once struck by\\nthe occurrence at irregular intervals of recurring groups, viz:\\n\\n\\n                   DACFTRR   ENO            BHAMOOUEA\\n                   DACFTEN   ENOUTHOMEAH    BHAMOOUEA\\n                             ENO\\n                   DACFTRR   DENOUTHOMEAH   IZTIE\\n                   FTEN      DENO           IZTIE\\n                             ENO\\n\\n\\nThis is a strong indication that the cipher is a substitution cipher,\\nso, to make an examination a frequency table will be constructed.\\n\\n\\n    Frequency Table\\n\\n    A    B    C   D   E    F   G   H    I    J   K   L   M\\n    23   11   7   6   24   7   3   26   16   0   1   8   8\\n\\n    N    O    P   Q   R   S    T    U    V   W   X   Y   Z\\n    15   36   3   2   8   14   17   11   1   3   0   3   2\\n\\n\\nSuperficially, this looks like a normal frequency table, but O is\\nthe dominant letter, followed by H, E, A, T, I, N, S, in the order\\nnamed. It is certainly Case 6 if it is a substitution cipher at all.', 'Let us see what can be done by assuming O=E; the triplet ENO, occurring\\nsix times might well be THE and E=T and N=H. A glance at the frequency\\ntable shows this to be reasonable. Now substitute these letters in some\\nlikely groups. FNOHOENO becomes _HE_ETHE; FTEN becomes _TH; ENOENHO\\nbecomes THETH_E; ENOHO becomes THE_E. A bit of study will show that\\nF=W, T=I and H=R and the frequency table bears this out except that\\nH(=R) seems to occur too frequently. The recurring groups containing\\nDAC (see above) occur in such a way that we may be sure DAC is one\\nword, FTRR is another and FTEN(=WITH) is a third. Now FTRR becomes\\nWI__, which can only be completed by a double letter. LL fills the\\nbill and we may say R=L. As DAC starts the message and is followed\\nby FTRR (=WILL) it is reasonable to try DAC=YOU. Looking up DAC in\\nthe frequency table it is evident that we strain nothing by this\\nassumption. We now have:\\n\\n\\n                 Letters of cipher    ONTAHECFD\\n                 Letters of message   EHIORTUWY\\n\\n\\nNow take the group ENOUTHOMEAH which occurs twice. This\\nbecomes THE_IRE_TOR and if we substitute U=D and M=C we have THE\\nDIRECTOR. Next the group (FTRR)BHAMOOUEA becomes (WILL) _ROCEEDTO\\nand the context gives word with missing letter as PROCEED, from\\nwhich B=P. Next the group (ENO) IZTIETASMOSEOHIEYOCK(FNOHO) becomes\\n(THE)__I_TIO_CE_TER_T_EU_(WHERE) and the group (FTEN)EFAPHOSMNIZTIEAHL\\nbecomes (WITH)TWO_RE_CH__I_TOR_. The substitution of A for I, V for\\nZ, N for S and F for P makes the latter group read (WITH TWO FRENCH\\nAVIATORS and the former read (THE)AVIATION CENTER AT _EU_(WHERE).\\n\\nNow the word YOCK = (_EU_) is the name of a place, evidently. We\\nfind another group containing Y, viz: ENOSTSMAYBISD which becomes\\nTHENINCO_PANY so that evidently we should substitute M for Y. The\\nother occurrence of Y (=M) is in the group EAYOEQISU which becomes\\nTOMET_AND. A reasonable knowledge of geography gives us the words\\nMEUX and METZ so that X should be substituted for K and Z for Q.\\n\\nWe now have sufficient letters for a complete deciphering of the\\nmessage.\\n\\n\\n             Letters of cipher    ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWYZ\\n             Letters of message   OPUYTW_RAXSCHEFZLNID__MV\\n\\n\\nThe message deciphers:\\n\\n\\n    YOU WILL PROCEED TO THE AVIATION CENTER AT MEUX WHERE THE DIRECTOR\\n    HAS _EEN ORDERED TO FURNISH YOU WITH A HI_H POWER _LERIOT\\n    AEROPLANE.

This cipher is difficult only because the cipher alphabet is\\nmade up, not haphazard, but scientifically with proper consideration\\nfor the natural frequency of occurrence of the letters. In cipher work\\nit is dangerous to neglect proper analysis and jump at conclusions.', 'In the study of Mexican substitution ciphers, several alphabets have\\nbeen found which are made up in a general way, like the one discussed\\nin this case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCase 6-c.--It is a convenience in dealing with ciphers made up of\\nnumbers or conventional signs to substitute arbitrary letters for\\nthe numbers and signs.

These methods date back several hundred years,\\nbut variations of them are constantly appearing as new ciphers. The\\nLarrabee cipher, used for communication between government departments,\\nis the Vigenere cipher of the 17th Century. The cipher disk method\\nis practically the Vigenere cipher with reversed alphabets.', 'In using these ciphers, there is provided a number of different cipher\\nalphabets, usually twenty-six, and each cipher alphabet is identified\\nby a different letter or number. A key word or phrase (or key number)\\nis agreed upon by the correspondents. The message to be enciphered is\\nwritten in lines containing a number of letters which is a multiple\\nof the number of letters of the key. The key is written as the first\\nline. Then each column under a letter of the key is enciphered by the\\ncipher alphabet pertaining to that letter of the key. For example,\\nlet us take the message, \"All radio messages must hereafter be put\\nin cipher,\" with the key Grant, using the Vigenere cipher alphabets\\ngiven below. Each of these alphabets is identified by the first or left\\nhand letter which represents A of the text. We thus will use in turn\\nthe alphabets beginning with G, with R, with A, with N, and with T.\\n\\n\\n                 G   R   A   N   T   G   R   A   N   T\\n\\n                 A   L   L   R   A   D   I   O   M   E\\n                 S   S   A   G   E   S   M   U   S   T\\n                 H   E   R   E   A   F   T   E   R   B\\n                 E   P   U   T   I   N   C   I   P   H\\n                 E   R\\n\\n\\nUsing the alphabet indicated by G, we get\\n\\n\\n                                 G   J\\n                                 Y   Y\\n                                 N   L\\n                                 K   T\\n                                 K\\n\\n\\nContinuing for the other alphabets, we get\\n\\n\\n                 G   C   L   E   T   J   Z   O   Z   X\\n                 Y   J   A   T   X   Y   D   U   F   M\\n                 N   V   R   R   T   L   K   E   E   U\\n                 K   G   U   G   B   T   T   I   C   A\\n                 K   I\\n\\n\\nThis method of arranging the message into lines and columns and then\\nenciphering whole columns with each cipher alphabet is much shorter\\nthan the method of handling each letter of the message separately. The\\nchance of error is also greatly reduced.\\n\\nAll these cipher methods can be operated by means of squares containing\\nthe various alphabets, cipher disks or arrangements of fixed and\\nsliding alphabets.

For example, if the key word is BAD, the second,\\nfirst and fourth alphabets are used in turn and the word WILL is\\nenciphered XIOM.\\n\\nThe Larrabee cipher is merely a slightly different arrangement of\\nthe Vigenere cipher and is printed on a card in this form:', '----------------------------------\\n                A       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\\n                        abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\\n                ----------------------------------\\n                B       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\\n                        bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza\\n                ----------------------------------\\n                C       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\\n                        cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab\\n                ----------------------------------\\n                etc.\\n                ----------------------------------\\n                Y       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\\n                        yzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\\n                ----------------------------------\\n                Z       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\\n                        zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy\\n                ----------------------------------\\n\\n\\nThe large letters at the left are the letters of the key word. It\\nwill be noted that these letters correspond to the first letters of\\nthe cipher alphabets (in small letters) as in the Vigenere cipher.\\n\\nA much simpler arrangement of the Vigenere cipher is the use of a\\nfixed and sliding alphabet. Either the fixed or sliding alphabet must\\nbe double in order to get coincidence for every letter when A is set\\nto the letter of the key word.\\n\\n\\n                     Fixed Alphabet of Text\\n    |                                                     |\\n    |ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ |\\n    +-----------------------------------------------------+\\n         |  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ               |\\n         |                                           |\\n         |       Movable Alphabet of Cipher          |\\n         +-------------------------------------------+\\n\\n\\nAs shown here, A of the fixed or text alphabet coincides with T\\nof the movable cipher alphabet. This is the setting where T is the\\nletter of the key word in use. The lower movable alphabet is moved\\nfor each letter of the message and the A of the fixed alphabet is\\nmade to coincide in turn with each letter of the key before the\\ncorresponding letter of the text is enciphered. It is obviously\\nonly a step from this arrangement to that of a cipher disk, where\\nthe fixed alphabet, (a single one will now serve) is printed in a\\ncircle and the movable alphabet, also in a circle, is on a separate\\nrotatable disk. Coincidence of any letter on the disk with A of the\\nfixed alphabet is obtained by rotating the disk.\\n\\nThe well known U. S. Army Cipher Disk has just such an arrangement of\\nthe fixed alphabet but the alphabet of the disk is reversed. This has\\nseveral advantages in simplicity of operation but none in increasing\\nthe indecipherability of the cipher prepared with it. The arrangement\\nof fixed and sliding alphabets which is equivalent to the U. S. Army\\ncipher disk is this:', 'Fixed Alphabet\\n    |                                                      |\\n    | ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ |\\n    +------------------------------------------------------+\\n          |  ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA              |\\n          |                                          |\\n          |             Movable Alphabet             |\\n          +------------------------------------------+\\n\\n\\nIt will be noticed that with this arrangement of running the alphabets\\nin opposite directions, it becomes immaterial which alphabet is used\\nfor the text and which for the cipher for if A = G then G = A. This\\nis not true of the Vigenere cipher.\\n\\nIt is perfectly feasible to substitute a card for the U. S. Army\\ncipher disk.

It is immaterial, in the following analysis, which\\nvariety has been used. The analysis is really based on what can be\\ndone with a cipher made up with a mixed cipher alphabet which may\\nbe moved with reference to the fixed alphabet of the text, (See Case\\n7-b). Clearly this is a much more difficult proposition than dealing\\nwith a cipher in which the cipher alphabets run in their regular\\nsequence, either backward or forward. In fact, in the analysis of Case\\n7, we may consider any cipher prepared by the method of Vigenere or\\nany of its variations as a special and simple case.', 'It was long ago discovered that, in any cipher of this class,\\n(1) two like groups of letters in the cipher are most probably the\\nresult of two like groups of letters of the text enciphered by the\\nsame alphabets and (2) the number of letters in one group plus the\\nnumber of letters to the beginning of the second group is a multiple\\nof the number of alphabets used. It is evident, of course, that we\\nmay have similar groups in the cipher which are not the result of\\nenciphering similar groups of the text by the same alphabets but if\\nwe take all recurring groups in a message and investigate the number\\nof intervening letters, we will find that the majority of such cases\\nwill conform to these two principles.\\n\\nChanging the key word and message to illustrate more clearly the\\nabove points, the following is quoted from the Signal Book, 1914,\\nwith reference to the use of the cipher disk in preparing a message\\nwith a key word. [2]\\n\\n\"--This simple disk can be used with a cipher word or, preferably,\\ncipher words, known only to the correspondents....

The first letter of\\nthe message to be enciphered is \\'A\\': \\'d\\' is found to be the letter\\nconnected with \\'A\\', and it is put down as the first cipher letter. The\\nletter \\'a\\' is then brought under \\'I\\' which is the second letter of the\\nkey word. \\'R\\' is to be enciphered and \\'r\\' is found to be the second\\ncipher letter.... Proceed in this manner until the last letter of the\\nkey word is used and beginning again with the letter \\'D\\', so continue\\nuntil all letters of the message have been enciphered.

Let us\\nconsider it tentatively as E. Then if the cipher alphabet runs\\nregularly and in the direction of the regular alphabet, C (7 times)=A\\nand the cipher alphabet bears a close resemblance to the regular\\nfrequency table. Note TUV (=RST) occurring respectively 7, 7, and 5\\ntimes and the non-occurrence of B, L, M, R, S, Z, (=Z, J, K, P, Q,\\nand X respectively.)\\n\\nIn the next table, L occurs 19 times and taking it for E with the\\nalphabet running in the same way, A=H. The first word of our message,\\nCT, thus becomes AM when deciphered with these two alphabets and the\\nfirst two letters of the key are C H.', 'Similarly in the third table we may take either F or O for E, but a\\ncasual examination shows that the former is correct and A=B (even if\\nwe were looking for a vowel for the next letter of the keyword).\\n\\nIn the fourth table, I is clearly E and A=E. The fifth table shows\\nT=14 and J=9. If we take T=E we find that we would have many letters\\nwhich should not occur. On the other hand, if we take J=E then\\nT=O and in view of the many E\\'s already accounted for in the other\\ncolumns, this may be all right. It checks as correct if we apply the\\nlast three alphabets to the second word of our message, OSB, which\\ndeciphers NOW. Using these alphabets to decipher the whole message,\\nwe find it to read:\\n\\n\\n    \"M. B. Am now safe on board a barge moored below Tower Bridge\\n    where no one will think of looking for me.

The percentages are respectively 49.5%, 75% and 100%\\nand we may be certain from this that six alphabets were used. But,\\nbefore the six frequency tables are made up, there is one more point\\nto be considered; why are there so many recurring groups which do not\\nhave six as a factor? The answer is that one or more of the alphabets\\nis repeated in each cycle; that is, a key word of the form HAVANA has\\nbeen used. If this were the key word, the second, fourth and sixth\\nalphabets would be the same. We will see later that in this example\\nthe second and sixth alphabets are the same and this introduces the\\ngreat number of recurring groups without the factor 6.\\n\\nWe will now proceed to make a frequency table for each alphabet. As\\nthe message is written in thirty columns, we take the first, seventh,\\nthirteenth, etc., as constituting the first alphabet; the second,\\neighth, fourteenth, etc., as constituting the second alphabet and\\nso on. The prefix and suffix letter is noted for each occurrence\\nof each letter. The importance of this will be appreciated when the\\nform of the frequency tables is examined. None bears any resemblance\\nto the normal frequency table except that each is evidently a mixed\\nup alphabet.

Clearly several mixed alphabets have\\nbeen used. As was to be expected from the analysis of the recurring\\ngroups, we note that the frequency tables for alphabets 2 and 6 are\\nof so nearly the same general form that certainly these two alphabets\\nare one and the same. If a Spanish word has been used as a key word,\\nthis means that A is probably represented by a vowel in these two\\nalphabets and probably equals A or O, because these two letters are\\nsuch common finals in Spanish.\\n\\n1st Alphabet. Probable vowels T, X; probable common consonants, B, I,\\nN, R. We conclude this because of the frequency of occurrence of T and\\nX and the variety of their prefixes and suffixes. On the other hand, B,\\nI, N, and R have for prefixes and suffixes, in a majority of cases, E,\\nF, O and S which are the probable vowels in the 2d and 6th alphabets.\\n\\n2d and 6th Alphabets.--Probable vowels E, F, O, S; probable common\\nconsonants, D, J, Q, U, Y.\\n\\n3d Alphabet.--Probable vowels C, I, L; probable common consonants A,\\nQ, T, Y.\\n\\n4th Alphabet.--Probable vowels, E, G, S, T; probable common consonants,\\nC, M, N, P, U, X.\\n\\n5th Alphabet.--Probable vowels, D, L, U; probable common consonants,\\nC, H, I.\\n\\nNow this cipher may have been made up from five distinct alphabets\\nwith letters chosen at random but it is much more likely to have\\nbeen prepared with a cipher disk or equivalent, having the regular\\nalphabet on the fixed disk and the mixed alphabet on the movable\\ndisk. An equivalent form of apparatus (not using the mixed alphabet\\nin question) is one like this:', \"|               Fixed Alphabet of Text                 |\\n    |   ABCDEFGHIJLMNOPQRSTUVXYZABCDEFGHIJLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ   |\\n    +------------------------------------------------------+\\n         |          PCJVRQZBAODFSUTMXIYHLGEN        |\\n         |         Movable Alphabet of Cipher        |\\n         +-------------------------------------------+\\n\\n\\nHere A of the plain text is enciphered by S and the other letters come\\nas they will. If we move the cipher alphabet one space to the left,\\nA will be enciphered by U and the whole sequence of the alphabet will\\nbe changed.\\n\\nWe will therefore use some such form as the above and see if we can\\ninsert our letters, as they are determined, in such a way as to have\\neach of the cipher slips identical. We may start thus:\\n\\n\\n                   ABCDEFGHIJLMNOPQRSTUVXYZABCDEFGHIJLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ\\n    1st Alphabet                          t   x\\n    2d                                    ol qei ms  d c u\\n    3d                                   ol qei ms  d c u\\n    4th                               ol qei ms  d c u\\n    5th                                   d c u      ol qei  ms\\n    6th                                   ol qei ms  d c  u\\n\\n\\nIn the 1st alphabet, T and X are placed as A and E respectively on the\\nbasis of frequency. In the 2d and 6th alphabets, O and E are placed as\\nA and E respectively on the basis of frequency. In the 4th alphabet,\\nE and S are placed as A and E, and in the 5th, D, U and L are placed\\nas A, E and O for the same reason. We now have an excess of E's and\\na deficiency of A's, which will be corrected if, in the 3d alphabet,\\nwe place L, I and C as A, E and O respectively. As a check, this\\ngives us TOLEDO as the key word.\\n\\nIn the second alphabet, O is four letters to the left of E; we may\\nplace O four letters to the left of E in the fourth and it comes under\\nV. Note that in the fourth frequency table O (=V) does not occur. In\\nthe same way in the fourth alphabet, S is four letters to the right\\nof E; placing it in the same position with respect to E in the second\\nand sixth, we have S under I. We have already noted that S probably\\nrepresents a vowel in these two alphabets. In this way, we may add\\nD and U to the third alphabet from their position in the fifth with\\nrespect to L and we may add I and O to the fifth from their position\\nin the third with respect to L. In every case we check results from\\nthe frequency tables and find nothing unlikely in the results.\\n\\nNow in the second and sixth, let us try Q, D and U as D, N and R\\nrespectively. We may add these letters to the third, fourth and\\nfifth alphabets by the method of observing the number of letters to\\nthe right or left of some letter already fixed. We now add L to the\\nsecond, third, fourth and sixth from its position with reference to\\nD and U in the fifth. M is probably D in the fourth and we may add\\nit to each of the alphabets, except the first, in the same way. The\\ntable is now complete as shown.\", 'Let us try these letters on the first line of the message and see if\\nsome other letters will be self-evident.\\n\\n\\nAlphabet     1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6\\nMessage      D D L R M E R G L M U J T L L C H E R S L S O E E S M E J U\\nDeciphered   _ N A _ U E _ _ A D E _ A B A L _ E _ I A E N E _ I G A _ R\\n\\n\\nReferring to our frequency tables as a check on suppositions, we find\\neverything agrees well enough if we assume the first line to read:\\n\\n\\n                    UNAFUERZA DE CABALLERIA ENEMIGA\\n\\n\\nWe will now put the newly found letters in the table. The letters\\npreviously found are in capitals and the new letters in small\\nletters.

The\\nfollowing message is received from A by B\\'s radio station (and  other\\nlistening stations) and about an hour later there is a good deal of\\nnoise and movement as if B\\'s force were breaking camp.', 'IIHAH   YDXRP   EGQGV   JJEEE   HOBGV\\n                 GJCAG   XAESA   VVXLE   IILHM   PSQAG\\n                 BDGAV   GSQAZ\\n\\n\\nThis is a substitution cipher, but it is not Case 6 using the usual\\nalphabet of the communications from A to B and, in fact, is not Case\\n6 at all.

The\\nonly possible key for the message is a five-letter one made up of the\\nletters BEFCH or EFCHB or FCHBE or CHBEF or HBEFC. If the key in this\\ncase were a word, we would have no difficulty in determining it; as it\\nis, there is no real difficulty in the matter as we may now divide the\\nmessage into blocks of five letters and note that ZSZ (=YOU) form the\\n3d, 4th and 5th letters of a group.

It is, however, a\\nwonderfully short cut in difficult cases where the other methods fail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nCase 8. The Playfair cipher. This is the English military field cipher;\\nas the method is published in English military manuals and as it is\\na cipher of proven reliability, it may be met with in general cipher\\nwork. The Playfair cipher operates with a key word; two letters are\\nsubstituted for each two letters of the text.\\n\\nThe Playfair cipher may be recognized by the following points: (a)\\nIt is a substitution cipher, (b) it always contains an even number of\\nletters, (c) when the cipher is divided into groups of two letters\\neach, no group consists of the repetition of the same letter as SS\\nor BB, (d) there will be recurrence of pairs throughout the message,\\nfollowing in a general way, the frequency table of digraphs of pairs,\\n(e) in short messages there may be recurrence of cipher groups\\nrepresenting words or even phrases, and these will always be found\\nin long messages.\\n\\nIn preparing a cipher by this method, a key word is chosen by the\\ncorrespondents. A large square, divided into twenty-five smaller\\nsquares, is constructed as shown below and the letters of the key word\\nare written in, beginning at the upper left hand corner. If any letter\\nrecurs in the key word, it is only used on the first occurrence. The\\nremaining letters of the alphabet are used to fill up the square. It\\nis customary to consider I and J as one letter in this cipher and\\nthey are written together in the same square.\\n\\nIf the key word chosen is LEAVENWORTH, then the square would be\\nconstructed as follows:\\n\\n\\n                           L    E   A   V   N\\n                           W    O   R   T   H\\n                           B    C   D   F   G\\n                           IJ   K   M   P   Q\\n                           S    U   X   Y   Z\\n\\n\\nThe text of the message to be sent is then divided up into groups of\\ntwo letters each, and equivalents are found for each pair.\\n\\nEvery pair of letters in the square must be: Either (1) in the same\\nvertical line. Thus in the above example each letter is represented\\nin cipher by that which stands next below it, and the bottom letter by\\nthe top one of the same column; for instance, TY is represented by FV.\\n\\nOr (2) in the same horizontal line. Each letter in this case is\\nrepresented by that which stands next on its right, and the letter on\\nthe extreme right by that on the extreme left of the same horizontal\\nline with it; for instance RH is represented by TW.\\n\\nOr (3) at opposite corners of a rectangle. Each letter of the pair\\nis represented by the letter in the other corner of the rectangle in\\nthe same horizontal line with it; for instance TS is represented by WY.', 'If, on dividing the letters of the text into pairs, it is found that\\na pair consists of the same letter repeated, a dummy letter, as X,\\nY, or Z, should be introduced to separate the similar letters.\\n\\nIf the message to be sent were \"The enemy moves at dawn,\" it would\\nbe divided into pairs:\\n\\n\\n                     TH   EX   EN   EM   YM   OV   ES   AT   DA   WN\\n   and enciphered:   HW   AU   AL   AK   XP   TE   LU   VR   MR   HL\\n\\n\\nThe message is then broken up into groups of five letters for\\ntransmission.\\n\\nTo decipher such a cryptogram, (knowing the key word), the receiver\\ndivides it into pairs, and from his table finds the equivalent of\\nthese pairs, taking the letter immediately above each, when they are\\nin the same vertical line; those immediately on the left, when in the\\nsame horizontal line; and those at opposite angles of the rectangle\\nwhen this is formed.\\n\\nIt is evident, from the foregoing description, that any letter of\\nthe plain text may be represented in cipher by one of five letters,\\nviz: The one next below it and the other four letters in the same\\nhorizontal line with it in the square. Take, for example, the letter\\nD of the plain text, in combination with each of the other letters\\nof the alphabet. We have, using the key LEAVENWORTH:\\n\\n\\nDA DB DC DE DF DG DH DI DK DL DM DN DO DP DQ DR DS DT DU DV DW DX DY DZ\\nMR FC FD CA FG FB GR BM CM BA MX GA CR FM GM MD BX FR CX FA BR MA FX GX\\n\\n\\nThis gives D represented by   B   C   F   G   M\\n                              4   4   8   4   4   times,\\n\\nand, connected with these five letters representing D,\\nwe have                          A   R   D   M   X   B   C   G\\n                                 5   5   2   4   5   1   1   1   times.\\n\\nNote that these letters are those of the vertical column containing\\nD plus the letters B, C and G, of the horizontal line containing D.\\n\\nLieut. Frank Moorman, U. S. Army, has developed a method for\\ndetermining the letters which make up the key word in a Playfair\\ncipher. In the first place, a key word necessarily contains vowels in\\nthe approximate proportion of two vowels to three consonants and it is\\nalso likely that a key word will contain other common letters.

As there are but two vowels for seven\\nletters, we will add A to the list on account of its occurrences with\\nB, D, E, R, and X. This leaves the letters for the bottom lines of\\nthe square as follows:', '+----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  . |  . |  . |  . |  . |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  . |  . |  . |  C |  D |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  G |  H  | IJ|  K |  L |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  M |  N |  P |  Q |  S |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  U |  V  | W |  Y |  Z |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n\\n\\nReferring to the table again we find the most frequent combination to\\nbe EL, occurring 8 times, with no occurrence of LE. Now, TH is the\\ncommonest pair in plain text, and HT is not common. The fact that\\nH occurs in the same horizontal line with L and that E and T are\\nprobably in the key, will lead us to put E in the first line over H\\nand T in the first line over L, so as to make EL equal TH.\\n\\nThe next most frequent combination is PR occurring 7 times, with RP\\noccurring twice. In the square as partially arranged, PR equals M_\\nor N_ or Q_ or I_. We may eliminate all these except N_, and this N_\\ncould only be NO or NA, so that we will put, tentatively the R in\\nthe second line over H and the O and A in the same line over IJ. We\\nhave then:\\n\\n\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  . |  E |  . | .  |  T |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  . |  R | AO |  C |  D |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  G |  H | IJ |  K |  L |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  M |  N | P  |  Q |  S |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  U |  V |  W |  Y |  Z |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n\\n\\nLet us now check this by picking out the combinations beginning with EL\\nand seeing if the table will solve them. We find, ELTV, ELAB, ELBXFZ,\\nELBXBT, ELAXCWBY, ELAXCWEQ, ELRH, ELBXFS. Now, on the assumption that\\nthe letter after EL represents E, we have it represented by A three\\ntimes, B three times, R once and T once. This requires that A and B\\nbe put in the same horizontal line with E, since T is already there,\\nand R is tentatively under E.', 'The combination ELTV now equals THEZ. If the T were moved one place\\nto the left, it would be THEY, a more likely combination, but this\\nrequires the L to be moved one place to the left also, by putting I\\nor K in the key word and taking out O, R or X and returning it to its\\nplace in the alphabetical sequence. The most frequent pairs containing\\nO are B O six times, R O four times, and O X three times. Now these\\npairs equal respectively E N, E S and H E, if O is put between N\\nand P in the fourth line. We will therefore cease to consider it\\nas a letter of the the key word. The combination ELAB can only be\\nTHE_ on the assumption that A is the first letter to the right of\\nE. The combination ELBX occurs three times. If it represents THE_,\\nthe B must be the first letter of the first line and the X must now\\nbe placed under E where the R was tentatively put. We can get THE_\\nout of ELRH by putting R in the first line or leaving it where it\\nis, but the preponderance of the BX combination should suggest the\\nformer alternative.\\n\\nA new square showing these changes will look like this:\\n\\n\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  B |  E |  A |  T |  R |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  . |  X |  . |  . |  . |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  G |  H |  . |  L |  M |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  N |  O | P  |  Q |  S |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n                       |  U |  V |  W |  Y |  Z |\\n                       +----+----+----+----+----+\\n\\n\\nAs I put in the space under B will give the word BEATRIX and as a\\nvowel is clearly necessary there, we will so use the IJ and leave\\nK between H and L. This leaves C, D and F to be placed. It appeared\\nat first that F was in the key but if it is in the second line, in\\nproximity to the letters of the first line, it will give the same\\nindications.

Also the groups 11 to 19\\nand 21 to 29 have a frequency fitting well with the normal frequency\\ntable of the letters A to I; the groups 41 to 49 and 71 to 79 have a\\nfrequency fitting well with the normal frequency table of the letters\\nK to S; and the groups 31 to 36 and 51 to 56 have a frequency fitting\\nwell with the normal frequency table of the letters U to Z.

In case such groups\\nare found, the meaning must be guessed at from the context; but if\\nmany messages in the same cipher are available, the meaning of these\\ngroups will soon be obtained. The appearance of such odd groups of\\nfigures in a message does not interfere materially with the analysis,\\nand it will be apparent at once on deciphering the message that they\\nrepresent whole words instead of letters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nOTHER SUBSTITUTION METHODS\\n\\n\\nThe foregoing cases by no means exhaust the possibilities of the\\nsubstitution cipher but they cover practically all methods which\\nare satisfactory for military purposes, having in mind conservation\\nof time, the minimizing of mental strain, and the requirements that\\ncomplicated apparatus and rules be avoided, and that the resulting\\ncipher should be adapted to telegraphic correspondence.\\n\\nA message may be re-enciphered two or more times using a different key\\nword each time or it may be enciphered by one method and re-enciphered\\nby another method, using the same or a different key word. Complicated\\ncipher systems requiring the memorizing of, or reference to, numerous\\nrules have been devised for special purposes. Such systems usually\\nfail utterly if there are any errors in transmission and it will be\\nseen later that such errors are very common.\\n\\nThere are several ingenious cipher machines by which complicated\\nciphers can be formed, but if the apparatus is available and fairly\\nlong messages are at hand for examination, it is usually possible to\\nsolve them. Such machines are not, as a rule, simple and small enough\\nfor field use; and it must always be remembered that a machine cipher\\noperates on certain mechanical cycles, which can be determined if\\nthe machine is available.', 'A book by Commandant Bazeries, entitled \"Etude sur la Cryptographie\\nMilitaire,\" and a series of articles by A. Collon, entitled \"Etude\\nsur la Cryptographie,\" which appeared in the Revue de L\\'Armée Belge,\\n1899-1902, give illustrations and details of operation of several\\nof these cipher machines and the latter goes into the methods of\\ndeciphering messages enciphered with them. These methods of analysis\\nrequire long messages, and as each one is adapted only to the product\\nof a certain machine or apparatus, it is not considered advisable to\\ninclude a discussion of them here. Those interested in such advanced\\ncipher work must refer to these and other European authors on the\\nsubject.\\n\\nThe requirement that cipher messages should be adapted to telegraphic\\ntransmission, practically excludes ciphers in which three or more\\nletters or whole words are substituted for each letter of the plain\\ntext. Such ciphers might be used for the transmission of very short\\nmessages but in no other case.\\n\\nThe cipher of Case 7, with a key word or phrase longer than one-fourth\\nof the message, the cipher after the method of Case 7, using a\\ncertain page of a book as a key, and the cipher with a running\\nkey, where each letter of the cipher is the key for enciphering\\nthe next letter, all look safe and desirable, theoretically, but,\\npractically, the work of enciphering and deciphering is hopelessly\\nslow, and errors in enciphering or transmission make deciphering very\\ndifficult. Incidentally the first and second of these ciphers can\\nbe solved by the special solution for Case 7, and the third can be\\nsolved by trying each of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet as\\nthe first key letter, and then continuing the work for five or six\\nletters of the cipher. When the proper primary key letter is found,\\nthe solution of the next five or six letters of the cipher will make\\nsense, and thereafter the cipher offers no difficulty.\\n\\nThere are numerous other methods of preparing what is virtually a\\nvery long, or even an indefinitely long key from a short key word,\\nbut all such cipher methods have the same practical disadvantages\\nof slowness of operation and difficulty in deciphering, if errors of\\nenciphering or transmission have been made.\\n\\nThe ciphers of Napoleon were long series of numbers representing\\nletters, syllables and words. They were really codes; and a code\\nbased on these principles, but using letters instead of numerals,\\nmight be evolved very easily. The War Department Code, the Western\\nUnion Code, and, in fact, all codes are nothing but specialized\\nsubstitution ciphers in which each code word represents a letter,\\nword or phrase of the plain text.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCombined Transposition and Substitution Methods', \"Combined Transposition and Substitution Methods\\n\\nIt is evident that a message can be enciphered by any transposition\\nmethod, and the result enciphered again by any substitution method,\\nor vice versa. But this takes time and leads to errors in the work, so\\nthat, if such a process is employed, the substitution and transposition\\nciphers used are likely to be very simple ones which can be operated\\nwith fair rapidity.\\n\\nOn preliminary determination, a cipher prepared by such a combination\\nof methods will appear to be a substitution cipher to be solved as\\nsuch. The frequency table of the result will resemble the normal\\nfrequency table, although the message will still be unintelligible\\nand we will know at once that it is a transposition cipher for\\nfurther solution.\\n\\nThe substitution methods usually found in combination ciphers are\\nthose of Case 4, 5 and 6, and the transposition method is nearly\\nalways Case 1, and particularly the simple varieties of this case\\nlike the fence rail (Case 1-i), reversed writing or vertical writing.\\n\\nA few examples will show some of the possible combinations.\\n\\nThe first line of the message of Case 4-a is:\\n\\n\\n                               OBQFOBPBRP\\n\\n\\nWe might write it BFBBPOQOPR (Case 1-i), or PRBPBOFQBO (Case 1,\\nreversed writing), or OFQBOPRBPB (Case 1, reversed by groups of five).\\n\\nThe first line of the message of Case 2-b is:\\n\\n\\n                     SLCOF WEETN EBRDO ORVYM FFEDI\\n\\n\\nWe might write it TMDPG XFFUO FCSEP PSWZN GGFEJ, or RKBNE VDDSM DAQCN\\nNQUXL EEDCH (Case 4-a, going forward one letter or back one letter).\\n\\n\\nThese examples give an idea of the use of combination methods. It is\\nvery rare to find both complicated transposition and substitution\\nmethods used in combination. If one is complicated, the other will\\nusually be very simple; and ordinarily both are simple, the sender\\ndepending on the combination of the two to attain indecipherability. It\\nis evident how futile this idea is.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMethods of Enciphering Numerals\\n\\nIt is frequently desirable to send numerals in the body of a cipher\\nmessage. Several cipher systems prescribe that all numerals in the\\nbody of a message must be spelled out; and, while there is no doubt\\nbut that this insures greater accuracy, it also greatly increases the\\nlength of such messages. In most systems in which it is permissible\\nto send numerals, the following system is used. An indicator, one of\\nthe little used letters and especially X, is interpolated before and\\nafter the numeral or numerals to be enciphered, and then, for each\\nnumeral, a letter is substituted using this or a similar table:\\n\\n\\n                 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0\\n                 A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J\\n\\n\\nThe enciphering of the message then proceeds, dealing with the\\nindicator and substituted letters as if they were the letters of a\\nword. The decipherer arriving at an X, a series of the letters of the\\nabove table and another X, casts out the X's and substitutes numbers\\nfor the letters.\", 'Sometimes no indicator is used, but the system of substitution of a\\ncertain letter for each numeral is followed. Again, the indicator NR\\nmay be used instead of a single letter.\\n\\nConventional letters may also be substituted for special characters\\nlike ?, $, \", -, and periods and commas, but this is rarely done except\\nfor the period and question mark. The context will usually determine\\nthe meaning of such letters when found. In this connection, the use\\nof X to represent end of a sentence and Q to represent a question\\nmark is quite common.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nERRORS IN ENCIPHERING AND TRANSMISSION\\n\\n\\nOne of the most difficult tasks before the cipher expert, is the\\ncorrection of errors which creep into cipher texts in the process of\\nenciphering and transmission by telegraph or radio.\\n\\nIn some cipher methods a mistake in enciphering one letter, or the\\nomission of one letter, will so mix up the deciphering process that\\nonly one familiar with such errors can apply the necessary corrections.\\n\\nThe transmission of cipher text over the telegraph or by radio is\\na slow process, and many fairly good operators cannot receive such\\nmatter satisfactorily, because they listen for words and guess at\\nletters at times. The spaced letters in American Morse are the cause\\nof so many errors in code transmission that the War Department Code\\ndoes not employ any groups using them. In fact, this code is limited\\nto the letters\\n\\n\\n         A   B   D   E   F   G   I   K   M   N   S   T   U   X\\n\\n\\nso that there may be a minimum of such confusion.\\n\\nIn cipher work it is necessary, under ordinary circumstances, to\\nuse any or all of the letters of the alphabet. To assist operators\\nin keeping the text straight, it is customary to divide cipher text\\ninto groups of four, five, six or ten letters, and usually groups of\\nfive letters are used. The receiving operator may then expect five\\nletters per group, and if he receives more or less he is sure that\\neither he or the sending operator has made an error. This division\\ninto groups of a constant number of letters eliminates word forms and,\\nin the mind of the non-expert, increases the difficulty of solving the\\ncipher. But the increase in difficulty is more apparent than real;\\nparticularly, as a cipher examiner habitually finds himself dealing\\nwith ciphers without word forms, and the occurrence of a cipher with\\nword forms usually means that he has an easy one to handle.\\n\\nMessages are occasionally encountered which consist partly of plain\\ntext and partly of cipher. The cipher part may or may not retain its\\nword forms, but, when this method is used, it is clearly impossible\\nto have a fixed number of letters in each cipher group if the word\\nforms are not used. It is almost impossible to prevent errors of\\ntransmission in such messages, and it often requires considerable\\nskill and labor to correct them.', 'For those unfamiliar with the telegraph alphabets, they are given\\nbelow. Messages sent by commercial or military telegraphs or buzzer\\nlines will be transmitted with the American Morse alphabet. Those sent\\nby radio, visual signalling or submarine cable will be transmitted\\nby Continental Morse, known also as the International Code. Messages\\nmay be transmitted by both alphabets in course of transmission. For\\nexample, a cablegram from the Philippines to Nome, Alaska, will be\\ntransmitted by Continental Morse (commercial cable) from Manila to San\\nFrancisco, by American Morse (commercial land line) from San Francisco\\nto Seattle, by Continental Morse (military cable) from Seattle to\\nValdez, by American Morse (military land line) from Valdez to Nulato\\nand by Continental Morse (military radio) from Nulato to Nome.\\n\\nPrior to February, 1914, the Mexican government telegraph lines used\\nan alphabet differing slightly from the American and Continental\\nMorse. However, at that time, the Continental Morse alphabet was\\nprescribed for use on these lines and it is believed that the use\\nof the old alphabet has entirely ceased on Mexican lines. However,\\nskilled American operators would have no difficulty in picking up\\nthis alphabet if it were found to be in use.\\n\\nRadio communication is, by International Convention, invariably in\\nContinental Morse.\\n\\n\\nTelegraph Alphabets\\n\\n    Character       American Morse   Continental Morse\\n                                     or International Code', 'A               . -              . -\\n    B               - . . .          - . . .\\n    C               . .  .           - . - .\\n    D               - . .            - . .\\n    E               .                .\\n    F               . - .            . . - .\\n    G               - - .            - - .\\n    H               . . . .          . . . .\\n    I               . .              . .\\n    J               - . - .          . - - -\\n    K               - . -            - . -\\n    L               --               . - . .\\n    M               - -              - -\\n    N               - .              - .\\n    O               .  .             - - -\\n    P               . . . . .        . - - .\\n    Q               . . - .          - - . -\\n    R               .  . .           . - .\\n    S               . . .            . . .\\n    T               -                -\\n    U               . . -            . . -\\n    V               . . . -          . . . -\\n    W               . - -            . - -\\n    X               . - . .          - . . -\\n    Y               . .  . .         - . - -\\n    Z               . . .  .         - - . .\\n    1               . - - .          . - - - -\\n    2               . . - . .        . . - - -\\n    3               . . . - .        . . . - -\\n    4               . . . . -        . . . . -\\n    5               - - -            . . . . .\\n    6               . . . . . .      - . . . .\\n    7               - - . .          - - . . .\\n    8               - . . . .        - - - . .\\n    9               - . . -          - - - - .\\n    0               ----             - - - - -\\n    Period          . . - - . .      . - . - . -\\n    Question Mark   - . . - .        . . - - . .\\n    Comma           . - . -          - - . . - -\\n\\n\\nThe following example will show some of the errors that creep into\\nmessages prepared with the cipher disk and transmitted by radio:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMessage\\n\\n\\n    Radio Douglas de El Paso, 2 H 71, twenty-fifth, 9:00 a.m.,\\n    Govt.

They will be taken up however for\\nanalysis of cause of error.\\n\\nLine 1, GF should be MA. Putting the latter into cipher we find the\\nletters of the cipher should have been GO instead of MJ. This is\\nclearly a telegrapher's error, --. --- becoming -- .---\\n\\nLine 2, L should be V. The corresponding cipher letter should be F\\ninstead of P. This is an error of the encipherer in copying.\\n\\nLine 2, SK should be EN. The corresponding cipher letters should be YU\\ninstead of KX. Another telegrapher's error, -.-- ..- becoming -.- -..-\\n\\nLine 3, Y should be I. The corresponding cipher letter should be L\\ninstead of V. Another error in copying by the encipherer.\\n\\nLine 4, JX should be OS. The corresponding cipher letters should be\\nFK instead of KF; an error on the part of the encipherer in copying.\\n\\nLine 7, V should be Y. A mistake in copying.\\n\\nLine 8, SKZRX. If we take X as a period, then this line might be OVER,\\nthe R being correct and SKZ being in question. The corresponding\\ncipher letters are AEO and if we encipher OVE we get ETJ. Here again\\nwe have a telegrapher's error, . - .--- becoming .- . ---\\n\\nLine 9, L should be I. The corresponding cipher letter should be K\\ninstead of H; an error in copying by the encipherer.\\n\\nThe errors by the encipherer above noted are fairly common ones. These\\nand similar errors are usually found when a cipher message, prepared\\nas a rough draft by the encipherer, is copied by a clerk and a careful\\ncheck of the copy is not made. The letters mistaken depend, of course,\\non the encipherer's hand writing or printing. Other errors, besides\\nthose noted, are the confusion of C, G, and Q; I, and J; B and R, etc.\\n\\nThe error by the encipherer, in not changing his disk setting for\\none letter and thus throwing out the whole process of deciphering,\\nwould not have occurred had he put the message into eight columns or a\\nmultiple thereof and enciphered each column with one disk setting. This\\nlatter method is also very much faster.\", 'Telegraphers\\' errors in cipher transmission are common and often\\nvery confusing. Note should be taken as to whether Continental or\\nAmerican Morse was used for transmission. An analysis along the lines\\nindicated will usually develop the error and correction. If not,\\na repetition should be demanded, calling attention, if possible,\\nto the particular groups that are not clear.\\n\\nThe deciphered and corrected message is:\\n\\n    \"Reliable information from Casas Grandes received here that a\\n    mounted detachment left there last night to escort shipment of\\n    arms and ammunition to be smuggled across border next Friday\\n    night, at a point twelve miles east of Douglas. This is in your\\n    district. Will you take necessary steps to prevent this shipment\\n    going over? Leader of smugglers said to be Juan Hernandez of Naco.\"\\n\\nAnother remarkable example of errors in transmission by American Morse\\nis the following: A message, partly in cipher and partly in plain text,\\ncontained the cipher words\\n\\n\\n                           GA GTXIEIT EIDISXQ\\n\\n\\nThis, deciphered as far as possible by the alphabet determined by\\nanalysis of the rest of the cipher, read\\n\\n\\n                           SU SME_Y_M Y_O_GES\\n\\n\\nIt was finally decided that the context required a single word like\\nSUSPENDIO or SUSPENDIOLES for this cipher group. An examination along\\nthis line showed that the cipher words should have been\\n\\n\\nreceived            G   A   G   L   X   C    U    R    D   P    X   G\\nand were received   G   A   G   T   X   IE   IT   EI   D   IS   X   Q\\n\\n\\nand that there were five errors in transmission in these three cipher\\ngroups alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNOTES\\n\\n[1] Occurrence rare, usually in proper names.\\n\\n[2] The method used is not the most satisfactory one for several\\nreasons and a better method is that of writing the message in multiples\\nof the key and enciphering the columns as already described.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MANUAL FOR THE SOLUTION OF MILITARY CIPHERS ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.', 'Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.', 'The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.']\n"
